Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed as part of learning and practicing basic programming concepts. The projects included are:

Number Guessing Game
ATM Machine Simulation
Student Grade Calculator
Each project has its own directory with the source code, and instructions on how to run and use the program.

1. Number Guessing Game
Description
  The Number Guessing Game is a simple game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback whether the guessed number is too high or too low until the 
  user guesses the correct number.
Features
   Random number generation
   User input for guesses
   Feedback for each guess
   Counter for the number of attempts
How to Run
    Navigate to the NumberGuessingGame directory.
    Compile the Java file: javac NumberGuessingGame.java
    Run the program: java NumberGuessingGame
   
2. ATM Machine Simulation
Description
    The ATM Machine Simulation mimics the basic functionalities of an ATM, such as checking account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. This program helps users understand the flow of operations in 
    an ATM.
Features
    User authentication
    Account balance inquiry
    Money deposit
    Money withdrawal
    Exit option
How to Run
   Navigate to the ATMMachine directory.
   Compile the Java file: javac ATMMachine.java
   Run the program: java ATMMachine

4. Student Grade Calculator
Description
   The Student Grade Calculator program calculates the final grade of a student based on the scores of multiple subjects. It allows input of scores and computes the average grade, determining the student's 
   performance.
Features
   Input for multiple subjects' scores
   Calculation of average score
   Determination of grade based on average score
How to Run
   Navigate to the StudentGradeCalculator directory.
   Compile the Java file: javac StudentGradeCalculator.java
   Run the program: java StudentGradeCalculator
